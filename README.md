## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ and npm

Install
```bash
npm install
```

Run (dev)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the printed local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

Build
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### 1) Quote form â†’ Google Sheet (SheetDB)
Set the endpoint via an environment variable:

Create `.env` (not committed):
```
VITE_SHEETDB_QUOTE_API=https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/wxhkcc0bvqvn9
```

In `src/pages/Quote.jsx`:
```js
const SHEETDB_API = import.meta.env.VITE_SHEETDB_QUOTE_API;
```

Expected Google Sheet columns:
```
Timestamp | Name | Email | Company | Services | Budget | Timeline | Priority | Description | Status | Notes
```

Newsletter: intentionally UI-only (no API calls).

### 2) Vercel SPA Rewrites (avoid 404 on deep links)
`vercel.json` forwards all routes to `index.html`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }],
  "headers": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "headers": [
      { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
      { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
      { "key": "Referrer-Policy", "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" }
    ]}
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ§© Key Components
- DarkVeil.jsx â€” OGL animated veil, responsive via ResizeObserver.
- SplitText.jsx â€” Char/word splitting, no-flash reveal, smooth stagger.
- TechCarousel.jsx â€” rAF seamless loop; local brand assets.
- Testimonials.jsx â€” 3 cards, circular photos, aligned content.
- ServicesPreview.jsx â€” Mirrors services offered (and used in Quote form).

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness
- `h-[100svh]` hero on mobile; clamped typography (`text-[vw]` + breakpoints).
- Grids: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3/4 columns.
- Global `overflow-x-hidden`.
- DarkVeil scales to container with DPR-aware sizing.

## ðŸ§­ Routes
- `/`        â†’ Landing Page
- `/about`   â†’ About (team, story, values)
- `/contact` â†’ Contact (Call, WhatsApp, Instagram)
- `/quote`   â†’ Get Quote (SheetDB submission)

## ðŸ–¼ Assets
- Tech logos: `src/assets/carousel/â€¦`
- Team photos: `src/assets/team/â€¦`
- Brochure PDF: imported in `LandingPage.jsx` and opened in a new tab.

## ðŸ”’ Accessibility & UX
- Skip link, landmarks, focus-visible styles.
- Reduced-motion guards.
- Reserved space to avoid layout shift in SplitText sequences.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting
- 404 on deep links (Vercel): ensure `vercel.json` is deployed (see rewrites).
- Assets not showing: verify import paths in `/src/assets`.
- SheetDB: check `VITE_SHEETDB_QUOTE_API` and column headers.

## ðŸ—º Future Improvements
- Section reveal timelines (GSAP/Framer Motion)
- Responsive image `srcset`
- CMS integration (Sanity)
- Unit tests for form logic and utilities
